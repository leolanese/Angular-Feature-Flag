# Angular Feature Flags

## APP_INITIALIZER Token

The `APP_INITIALIZER` token in Angular is a `dependency injection token` that allows you to load and initialize configuration information before the application starts. This ensures that necessary configuration data is available throughout the application as soon as it begins execution.

## Using APP_INITIALIZER for Feature Toggles

Implementing feature toggles in an Angular application using APP_INITIALIZER is a powerful technique. Feature toggles enable you to conditionally activate or deactivate specific features in your application based on configuration settings. This approach can be particularly useful for deploying features incrementally, performing A/B testing, or managing experimental features without the need to redeploy the entire application.

## Here's a detailed explanation and example of how to use APP_INITIALIZER to implement feature toggles in an Angular application:

```js
Steps to Implement Feature Toggles with APP_INITIALIZER
Create a Configuration Service:

This service will be responsible for fetching and storing the configuration data, including feature toggles.
Configure APP_INITIALIZER:

Use APP_INITIALIZER to ensure that the configuration service loads the feature toggles before the application starts.
Use Feature Toggles in Components:

Inject the configuration service into your components and use the feature toggles to conditionally display or hide features.
```

> We can efficiently manage feature toggles in your Angular application, ensuring that features are enabled or disabled based on configuration settings loaded during the app initialization phase.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
